# java-class-name

A small library and application to extract class names from Java sources.

Can be used as a library and via a binary (generated with GraalVM native image).

Mainly meant to be used by [Scala CLI](https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-cli)

## Authors

Support for inferring Java class names from sources was initially
added in Scala CLI by [Piotr Chabelski](https://github.com/Gedochao).
That support was later moved here by [Alex Archambault](https://github.com/alexarchambault).
